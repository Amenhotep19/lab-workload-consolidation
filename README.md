# Intel Industrial Workload Consolidation Workshop

Welcome to the Intel Industrial Workload Consolidation Workshop. In this workshop, we will explore Industry 4.0 technologies through lectures and hands on labs. By the end of the workshop, you should have a solid understanding of different Industry 4.0 technologies and have some working ideas of how to implement them in your place of business.

***We want to give a big thank you to the Illinois Technology Association for providing the venue and the people to setup.***
